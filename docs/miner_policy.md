# Macrocosmos Miner Data Compliance Policy


*Version 1.0, March 2025*

---

## Introduction
As a miner on Macrocosmos Subnets, you play a crucial role in handling various types of data. This summary outlines your potential obligations under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) should you inadvertently collect personal data, and the expectations regarding prohibited content and acceptable use of Macrocosmos subnet code.
We expect any participant (however they may define themselves or their involvement) in our subnet ecosystems to adhere to the guidelines set out in this policy. Deliberate and consistent violation of these guidelines may result in Macrocosmos seeking to limit your ability to participate, support for your participation and/or your incentive rewards.
Miners and all other participants are responsible for their own legal and regulatory compliance procedures and are encouraged to seek advice if in any doubt as to how to proceed. Macrocosmos is available to provide informal guidance if required (see contact information below).

## 1. Your Responsibilities Under UK GDPR
While Macrocosmos does not directly collect or process data, and seeks to avoid incentivising any collection or interaction with personal data, as a miner, you may be subject to GDPR obligations if your activities result in the inadvertent or accidental collection of personal data. We recommend that you put in place appropriate policies and procedures to accommodate this eventuality and set out below a summary of key responsibilities:
1. Lawful Basis for Processing
    - You must ensure there is a lawful basis for collecting and processing any personal data (e.g., consent, legitimate interests, or legal obligation).
2. Transparency
    - Inform individuals about how their data is being collected, processed, and stored.
    - Provide clear privacy information, including the purpose and lawful basis for processing.
3. Data Minimization
    - Only collect and process data that is strictly necessary for your stated purpose.
    - Avoid collecting sensitive personal data unless absolutely required and lawful.
4. Upholding Individuals’ Rights
    - Be prepared to handle requests or objections from individuals regarding their right to access, rectify, limit processing of or delete their personal data in compliance with GDPR.
5. Data Security
    - Implement robust security measures to protect any data you collect from unauthorized access or breaches.
    - Ensure encryption and secure storage practices are in place.
6. Breach Reporting
    - Notify the appropriate data protection authority (e.g., ICO) within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach.

## 2. Prohibited Content
As a miner, you are strictly prohibited from collecting, processing, or transmitting the following types of content:
1. Illegal Content
    - Child abuse material or exploitation.
    - Hate speech, extremist propaganda, or content inciting violence.
    - Content related to human trafficking or modern slavery.
2. Copyrighted Material
    - Content protected by copyright unless you have explicit permission or a valid license to use it.
3. Explicit or Harmful Content
    - Pornographic or explicit imagery.
    - Content promoting self-harm, suicide, or drug abuse.

3. Acceptable Use Expectations
Macrocosmos expects all miners to:
Comply with platform-specific terms of service and relevant laws, including GDPR.
Use Macrocosmos subnets for ethical and lawful purposes only.
Regularly review and update your data collection and processing practices to ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards.
Immediately cease processing any flagged or prohibited material and report concerns to the appropriate authorities where required.
